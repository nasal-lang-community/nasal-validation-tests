# nasal-validation-tests 

A collection of Nasal scripts suitable for use in the validation of Nasal interpreters, grammars, tooling, etc. 

## Usage

This repository is essentially a dataset or suite of test cases. If you're writing a piece of Nasal tooling or a Nasal implementation,
you can use these scripts as test cases/fixtures. For an example of how this is done, see the [nasal-grammar] repository, which uses these test
cases to validate an ANTLR grammar of the Nasal language.
